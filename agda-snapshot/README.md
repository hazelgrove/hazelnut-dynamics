# hazelnut-dynamics-agda
This repository is the mechanization of the work described in our current
[draft paper](https://github.com/hazelgrove/hazelnut-dynamics). It includes
the full definitions of all the judgements and metafunctions in the draft
and proofs of many of the theorems. It is a work in progress, so not every
theorem is currently fully proven. The theorems listed in
[all.agda](all.agda) and not commented out are proven in full, however.

# Description of Agda Files

## Prelude and Datatypes

These files give definitions and syntactic sugar for common elements of
type theory (sum types, products, sigmas, etc.) and data structures
(natural numbers and lists) that are used pervasively throughout the rest
of the development.

- [List.agda](List.agda)
- [Nat.agda](Nat.agda)
- [Prelude.agda](Prelude.agda)

## Core Definitions

- [contexts.agda](contexts.agda) defines contexts as functions from natural
  numbers to possible contents and proves the relevant properties needed to
  make this definition usable.
- [core.agda](core.agda)

## Meta Concerns
- [all.agda](all.agda) is morally a make file: it includes every module in
  every other file, so running `$ agda all.agda` on a clean clone of this
  repository will recheck every proof from scratch. It is known to load
  cleanly with `Agda version 2.5.1.1`; we have not tested it on any other
  version.
- [structural-assumptions.agda](structural-assumptions.agda) is a file of
  postulates for standard structural properties about contexts and
  judgements that we have not yet proven. This will not be included in the
  final version of this mechanization, but it's helpful to have one place
  to look to know exactly what is being taken on faith and what's really
  proven. In a conservative sense, you can think of the rest of the
  theorems as being implied by in the postulates taken here rather than in
  their full form.

## Lemmas

These files contain small technical lemmas for the corresponding judgement
or theorem. They are generally not surprising once stated, although it's
perhaps not immediately why they're needed, and tend to obfuscate the actual
proof text. They are corralled into their own modules in an effort to aid
readability.

- [focus-formation.agda](focus-formation.agda)
- [ground-decidable.agda](ground-decidable.agda)
- [htype-decidable.agda](htype-decidable.agda)
- [lemmas-consistency.agda](lemmas-consistency.agda)
- [lemmas-ground.agda](lemmas-ground.agda)
- [lemmas-matching.agda](lemmas-matching.agda)
- [lemmas-progress-checks.agda](lemmas-progress-checks.agda)
- [lemmas-subst-ta.agda](lemmas-subst-ta.agda)
- [matched-ground-invariant.agda](matched-ground-invariant.agda)
- [synth-unicity.agda](synth-unicity.agda) argues that the synthesis
  judgement produces at most one type for a term.
- [finality.agda](finality.agda) argues that a final expression only steps
  to itself.

## Theorems

### Canonical Forms

Together, these files give the canonical forms lemma for the language. They
are broken down in a slightly more explicit way than in the paper text,
each type getting its own theorem, for usability later.

- [canonical-boxed-forms.agda](canonical-boxed-forms.agda)
- [canonical-indeterminate-forms.agda](canonical-indeterminate-forms.agda)
- [canonical-value-forms.agda](canonical-value-forms.agda)

### Metatheory of Type Assignment

- [type-assignment-unicity.agda](type-assignment-unicity.agda) argues that
  the type assignment system assigns at most one type to any term.

### Metatheory of Expansion

- [expansion-generality.agda](expansion-generality.agda) argues that the expansion
  judgements respect the bidirectional typing system.
- [expandability.agda](expandability.agda) argues that any well typed term
  can be expanded to a dynamic term.
- [expansion-unicity.agda](expansion-unicity.agda) argues that expansion
  produces at most one result.
- [typed-expansion.agda](typed-expansion.agda) argues that the expansion
  respects the type assignment system.

### Type Safety

These first three files contain proofs of type safety for the core
language, where terms and types may both have holes in them and still step.

- [progress.agda](progress.agda) argues that any `dhexp` that gets assigned
  a type either steps, is a boxed value, or is indeterminate
- [progress-checks.agda](progress-checks.agda) argues that the clauses in
  progress are disjoint---that is to say that no expression both steps and
  is a boxed value, etc.
- [preservation.agda](preservation.agda) argues that stepping preserves
  type assignment.

We also argue that our dynamics is a conservative extension in the sense
that if you use it to evaluate terms in the calculus that have no holes in
them, you get the same type safety theorems you might expect for the
restricted fragment without holes.

- [complete-expansion.agda](complete-expansion.agda) argues that the
  expansion of a complete term into the dynamic language produces another
  complete term.
- [complete-preservation.agda](complete-preservation.agda) argues that
  stepping a complete term produces a complete term that is assigned the
  same type
- [complete-progress.agda](complete-progress.agda) argues that complete
  terms are either a value or step.


### Metatheory of Instantiation

- [commutativity.agda](commutativity.agda) argues that stepping respects
  hole instantiation.
- [instantiation.agda](instantiation.agda) argues that hole instantiation
  respects type assignment
