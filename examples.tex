\newcommand{\overviewExample}[2]{\paragraph{Example {#1}: {#2}}}

We begin with an example-driven overview of our proposed approach  within the \Hazel programming environment \citet{HazelnutSNAPL}. \Hazel is an open source web lab notebook environment based roughly on IPython/Jupyter \cite{Perez:2007:ISI:1251563.1251831}. The language of \Hazel is tracking toward parity with \Elm, a popular pure functional programming language similar to ``core ML'' \cite{czaplicki2012elm,Elm}. We assume familiarity with the basic concepts of ML/Elm (see \url{http://elm-lang.org/}).

Both the user interface and the language of \Hazel are under active development. For the sake of 
exposition, we have ``post-processed'' the examples in this section to make use of several convenient language mechanisms from \Elm~that are not yet implemented in \Hazel as of this writing. These mechanisms are orthogonal to the contributions of this paper---we have implemented all of the live programming features described in this section, both in \Hazel and in the implementation of the core calculus included in the supplement (see Sec.~\ref{sec:implementation}).

% \paragraph{Recap}
% %
% In the above four subsections, respectively, we considered programs with:
% %
% (1) empty expression holes,
% %
% (2) non-empty expression holes for ill-typed expressions,
% %
% (3) type holes, and
% %
% (4) non-empty expression holes for well-typed expressions.
% %
% Next, we will formally describe the novel dynamic semantics of \HazelnutLive{}
% that allows programs with combinations of these kinds of incompleteness to be
% evaluated.
