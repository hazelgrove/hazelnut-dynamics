The language of \Hazel is tracking toward parity with \Elm, a popular pure functional programming language \cite{czaplicki2012elm,Elm}, 
and the user interface is a lab notebook interface based roughly on IPython/Jupyter \cite{Perez:2007:ISI:1251563.1251831}. 

We introduce \HazelnutLive{} in this section using several examples,
demonstrating how running incomplete programs---with missing expressions and/or
type-inconsistent expressions---can be useful.
%
We will also demonstrate how running even complete programs with subexpressions
marked as holes may be useful in debugging.

The screenshot at the top of \autoref{fig:grades-example} shows a mockup of
\Hazel{}, a work-in-progress programming environment that we are building on top
of our dynamic semantics.
%
\Hazel{} programs are written in OCaml \cite{leroy03:_ocaml}, using the
alternative Reason syntax \cite{reason-what} extended to support holes.
%
On the left side of the window is the \emph{edit action panel}, which
provides a user interface for performing structured edits to the program
displayed in the center of the window.
%
On the right side of the window is the \emph{environment panel}, which provides
static and dynamic information about the expression in the program currently in
focus (\ie{}~under the cursor).

Our current implementation, a reference implementation of the \HazelnutLive{}
calculus, provides the edit action, code, and environment panels as shown in
\autoref{fig:grades-example}, but does not yet provide support for many of the
programming constructs and syntactic sugar described in the examples in this
section.
%
\autoref{sec:implementation} describes the status of \HazelnutLive{} in more
detail.

%
%% As shown in \autoref{fig:grades-example}, a \HazelnutLive{} notebook is a
%% literate program \cite{knuth1984literate}: rich text comments appear at the top
%% level and code appears within cells embedded into these comments.
%
The reader is encouraged \rkc{(maybe not)}
to work through the following examples in our prototype
implementation or watch video demonstrations, both available in
\suppMaterials{}.

\paragraph{Recap}
%
In the above four subsections, respectively, we considered programs with:
%
(1) empty expression holes,
%
(2) non-empty expression holes for ill-typed expressions,
%
(3) type holes, and
%
(4) non-empty expression holes for well-typed expressions.
%
Next, we will formally describe the novel dynamic semantics of \HazelnutLive{}
that allows programs with combinations of these kinds of incompleteness to be
evaluated.
