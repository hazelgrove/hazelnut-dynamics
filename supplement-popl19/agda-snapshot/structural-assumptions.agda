module structural-assumptions where

-- this module contains the signatures of theorems that we intend to prove
-- in the finished artefact. they are all either canonical structural
-- properties of the hypothetical judgements or common properties of
-- contexts. we strongly believe that they are true, especially since
-- they're all standard, but have not yet proven them for our specific
-- choices of implementations.

-- the only assumptions not in this file are 1) for function extensionality
-- in Prelude.agda; funext is known to be independent of Agda, and we have
-- no intension of removing it, and 2) the structural properties in
-- structural.agda, and 3) the signature of applying a substitition to a
-- hole in core.agda
