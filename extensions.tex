\label{sec:extensions}

We give two extensions here, numbers and sum types, to maintain parity with \Hazelnut as specified by \citet{popl-paper}.

It is worth observing that these extensions do not make explicit mention of expression holes. The ``non-obvious'' machinery is almost entirely related to casts. Fortunately, there has been excellent work of late on generating ``gradualized'' specifications from standard specifications \cite{DBLP:conf/popl/CiminiS16}. The extensions below, and other extensions of interest, closely follow the output of the gradualizer: \url{http://cimini.info/gradualizerDynamicSemantics/} (which, like our work, is based on the refined account of gradual typing by \cite{DBLP:conf/snapl/SiekVCB15}). The rules for indeterminate forms are mainly where the gradualizer is not necessarily sufficient.
